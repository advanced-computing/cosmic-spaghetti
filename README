## Proposal: Housing Affordability & Evictions in New York City

### What dataset are you going to use?
NYC Open Data’s Evictions - We are going to use Evictions data from NYC Open Data. 
This dataset lists executed residential evictions across the five boroughs of New York City since 2017 
and contains detailed information that can be sorted by multiple categories, including court index number, borough etc.

ACS Census on Income Data Based on Boroughs – We are planning to use data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). 
Specifically, we will use the dataset Median Household Income,aggregated at the county level, which corresponds to New York City’s five boroughs. 
This dataset provides annual estimates of median household income and allows for comparison across boroughs.
However, these datasets are updated every year or every five years.

### What are your research question(s)?
Is there a relationship between borough-level median household income and eviction rates in New York City? 
> We’re looking to explore whether boroughs with lower median household incomes experience higher rates of executed evictions, 
> and whether these patterns vary over time.
Which NYC boroughs have the highest eviction rates (evictions per 1,000 renter households)?
How have eviction rates by borough changed over time since 2017?
Do evictions exhibit seasonal patterns across boroughs (e.g., summer vs. winter spikes)?

### What's the link to your notebook?

### What's your target visualization?
To answer these questions, we are planning to create the following visualisations:
(1) A choropleth map of New York City boroughs displaying eviction rates per 1,000 renter households, 
allowing for spatial comparison of eviction burden across the city.
(2) A bar chart showing the eviction rate per 1,000 renter households by borough, providing a clear comparison across boroughs.
(3) A line chart illustrating monthly eviction trends by borough, used to identify seasonality and changes over time. 

### What are your known unknowns?
Time to finish the project (we commit to make it an agile project, however we know that there is a deadline of the project)
Other factors that we can explore regarding this issue and whether we can find data to support it

##What challenges do you anticipate?
1. We would need other datasets to help us answer a policy question. For example, once we know that NYC has a housing crisis. 
2. How can we then use the current Evictions data set to help policymakers in making decisions about housing policies and potential housing developments? 
3. Furthermore, how can this dataset be complemented with other datasets on housing in NYC (e.g. renters vs owners, affordable housing developments, etc.). 
Are these datasets available, and are they updated consistently?
4. The existing dataset might be too narrow focused for making a dashboard that giving a broad information 
(we need another aspects of housing to add to make the dashboard a little more complex)
5. We are also considering another project to create a dashboard for the Department of Building NYC Project.

This dashboard might help policymakers plan and make better decisions, such as channeling the appropriate resources to maintain existing buildings and identifying boroughs with high violations.
Policy knowledge regarding the eviction and housing in general
